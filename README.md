RanGE (**Range Engine**) is a fork of UPBGE created by Rafael Tavares and some of his friends in August 2022.

RanGE is a light and powerfull game engine, and its aim is to clean up and improve current Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine 0.2.5b (UPBGE) code, experiment with new features, and implement forgotten features that have not been merged with the UPBGE trunk.
